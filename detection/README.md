# TIM: A Time Interval Machine for Audio-Visual Action Recognition

## Requirements

The requirements for TIM can be found in the main README of this repository.

## Features

The features used for this project can be extracted by following the instructions in the `feature_extractors` folder.

## Pretrained models

We provide the pretrained recognition models for TIM here:

[EPIC-100]()

[Perception Test]()

[AVE]()

## Ground-Truth

We provide the necessary ground-truth files for all datasets here:

[Train-Split]()

**NOTE:** These annotation files have been cleaned to be compatible with the TIM codebase

## Trainig TIM for Recognition

### EPIC-KITCHENS-100 & EPIC-Sounds

**NOTE:** Either dataset can be trained individually by changing the `data_modality` flag to either `audio` or `visual`

### Perception Test Action & Perception Test Sound

### AVE

## Validation

### EPIC-KITCHENS-100 & EPIC-Sounds

### Perception Test Action & Perception Test Sound

### AVE
